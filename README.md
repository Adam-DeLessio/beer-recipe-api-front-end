# Beer Recipes

### Goals
- Build a front end and connect it to the beer recipes API that I built prior.
- Have Create and Read capabilities.

### Description
> The main recipe page displays a list of beer recipes that I pulled from a different recipe API in order to get the page started.
> A user can navigate to the Add Recipe page and input data for a new recipe, to include multiple types of hops and grains, special instructions, 
> and a variety of number data. The new recipe will be added to the bottom of the main list.

### Technologies Used
- React
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

### Notes
> This project has full Read capabilities, and partial Create capabilities.
